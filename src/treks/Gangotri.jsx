							Bhojbasa 12,415 ft to Tapovan 14,203 ft
						</Typography>
						<p>Trek Distance: 6 km | Trek Duration: 9 hours</p>
						<p>Difficult. Gradual ascent for 2.5 hours. 2 hours glacier walk followed by 1 hour of moderate ascent. Final 1.5 hours is a steep ascent.</p>
						<span>
							&#x2022; Today we will trek from Bhojwasa to Tapovan. It is a 9 km long trek so eat full, get packed lunch, fill water bottles
						</span> <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>there are no water sources on the route.</span> <span>carry energy bars, and lots of excitement.</span>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>
							&#x2022; We will set off early in the morning and after walking for bout half a kilometer, we will arrive at the Bhagirathi River. To reach the Tapovan, we need to cross the river by means of a manually pulled trolley over the bridge.<br />
							&#x2022; It is a unique experience and this method is often used as a method of river crossing in the mountains where there are no bridges in place.<br />
							&#x2022; It takes about an hour for the entire batch to cross the river via a trolley so donâ€™t be impatient.<br />
						</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>
							&#x2022; After crossing the river, you will walk for about 2 km with rocks and stones on either side, this is also a potential rockfall-prone zone, so we will try to cross the area before lunchtime to avoid any potential rockfalls.<br />
							&#x2022; After crossing this zone, you have to cross the Akash Ganga River. <br />
							&#x2022;  Look for spots from where you can cross the river and if the water flow is high then you will have to take your shoes off to cross the stream.<br />

					<AccordionDetails>
						<Typography>
							&#x2022; You will be staying in tents on all days of the trek. <br />
							&#x2022; It is mandatory for trekkers to carry a copy of their photo ID for entry at forest check posts on the trek.<br />
							&#x2022; If the buffer day is used,  you must pay Rs 2,500 per day + 5% GST. The Trek Leader will only collect the money if we use the buffer day. This depends completely on the weather conditions on the trek, and the trek leader will take the call.<br />
							&#x2022; Please note: Twin sharing tents may not be available in May, June. This is because raw materials for making tents are sourced from different countries. But their export has been affected due to international unrest. This has led to a global shortage of tents. Having said that, you'll still have comfortable space as these tents have been designed to accommodate three trekkers.<br />
